Today I started to continue an old project of mine made with Symfony2.

It has been 5 months I don't edit a single line of this project!
So, I tried to update my dependencies running _composer update_ and got this error:

~~~ bash
You have requested a non-existent service "fos_user.doctrine_registry"
~~~

Just add these lines to your config.yml file:

~~~ yml
services:
    fos_user.doctrine_registry:
        alias: doctrine
~~~
