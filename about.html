## About

I started to programming at age of 15 on high school. Since then, I learnt several programming languages such as Object Pascal, Java, C, C++, PHP and Python.

Although I think a programmer may not be excelent in every single programming language, there are some languages that a programmer is very good at. Thus, my strongest skills are in C/C++ and PHP.

I lived for one year and half in Sydney, Australia during a scholar intership. With this, I may say that I'm quite fluent in English (by this time, you may have found some mistakes in this text, so the former statement is not true).
